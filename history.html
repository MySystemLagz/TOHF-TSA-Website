            <p class="lead">TOHF is a German company that makes electric vehicles.</p>
            <p class="lead">On January 24, 2046, the company was founded. The company took the name of Wolframâ€™s last name, Tohf.</p>
            <p class="lead">Planning for the first car started in 2047. TOHF wanted their first car to be a hit. With other competitors in the electric car industry, they had high expectations to uphold</p>
            <p class="lead">The first car, the TFX 1660Ti, was created and displayed to the public on November, 3, 2050. It was critically acclaimed by many and it put TOHF on the spotlight. The company had made a name for itself and now they had the foundation set in place.</p>
            <p class="lead">The second car, the TFX 1770Ti, was a car meant for the family. They wanted to make sure they reached every kind of user and so making a car for the family driver was necessary. It was released June 7, 2051. It was very popular, much like the TFX 1660Ti.</p>
            <p class="lead">Their latest car, the TFX 1880Ti, was not for the regular user. This one was a showcase of what an electric car is capable of and proving that they are just as good, and even, better than gas cars. It was a supercar and was pretty expensive. When it was released, many were surprised. The car was more expensive than the other cars they had made. Also, despite being an electric car, it performed as well as other supercars such as the Ferrari 488 and the Lamborghini Aventador.</p>
